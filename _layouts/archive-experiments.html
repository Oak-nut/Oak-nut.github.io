<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="#project1">Tidal Forecasting and Split Tide Analysis</a> (Basic ML)</strong></li>
  <li><strong><a href="#project2">PM2.5 Concentration and Meteorological Influence During Lockdown in Manchester</a> (Basic ML)</strong></li>
  <li><strong><a href="#project3">Comparison of Single-Moment and Double-Moment Macrophysics Schemes</a> (NWP)</strong></li>
  <li><strong><a href="#project4">WRFDA Project Contributions</a> (NWP)</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="project1">Tidal Forecasting and Split Tide Analysis (Basic ML)</h3>
<p>Analyzed tidal data from 2021 to 2023 using the T_TIDE model to examine partial tides. Key tides (K1, M2, M4) were analyzed for amplitude variations. Long-term prediction was limited due to data discontinuity.</p>

<h3 id="project2">PM2.5 Concentration and Meteorological Influence During Lockdown in Manchester (Basic ML)</h3>
<p>Explored the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on PM2.5 levels. Compared ML models (LightGBM, Extra Trees, Random Forest), finding that Random Forest had the best performance. SHAP analysis identified wind speed and air pressure as key meteorological factors.</p>

<h3 id="project3">Comparison of Single-Moment and Double-Moment Macrophysics Schemes (NWP)</h3>
<p>Simulated a rainstorm in East China using different schemes (Lin, Thompson, Morrison). Evaluated ETS scores, cold pool coverage, and precipitation distributions, with Thompson providing the most accurate stratiform cloud forecasts.</p>

<h3 id="project4">WRFDA Project Contributions (NWP)</h3>
<p>Focused on 4DVar data assimilation to produce high-resolution reanalysis datasets. Improved forecast accuracy using station and radar data, while optimizing physical parameters for extreme weather events.</p>
